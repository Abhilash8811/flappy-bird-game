2. ✅ A GitHub account created
3. ✅ A new repository created on GitHub

## Step-by-Step: Push Your Game to GitHub

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt in Your Game Folder

**Option A - Easy Way:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to your game folder (where index.html is)
3. Click in the address bar at the top
4. Type `cmd` and press Enter
5. Command Prompt opens in the right folder!

**Option B - Manual Way:**
1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. Type: `cd ` (with a space after cd)
4. Drag your game folder into the Command Prompt window
5. Press Enter

### Step 2: Check You're in the Right Place

Type this and press Enter:
```
dir
```

You should see your game files listed:
- index.html
- game.js
- package.json
- etc.

If you don't see these files, you're in the wrong folder. Go back to Step 1.

### Step 3: Initialize Git (First Time Only)

Copy and paste this command, then press Enter:
```
git init
```

You should see: `Initialized empty Git repository`

### Step 4: Add All Your Files

Copy and paste this command:
```
git add .
```

(That's `git add` followed by a period/dot)

No message means it worked! ✅

### Step 5: Commit Your Files

Copy and paste this command:
```
git commit -m "Initial commit - Flappy Bird game"
```

You should see a list of files being committed.

### Step 6: Rename Branch to Main

Copy and paste this command:
```
git branch -M main
```

No message means it worked! ✅

### Step 7: Connect to Your GitHub Repository

**IMPORTANT:** You need YOUR repository URL!

1. Go to your GitHub repository page in your browser
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Make sure **HTTPS** is selected (not SSH)
4. Click the copy icon to copy the URL
   - It looks like: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flappy-bird-game.git`

5. In Command Prompt, type:
```
git remote add origin YOUR-URL-HERE
```

**Example:**
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/john123/flappy-bird-game.git
```

### Step 8: Push to GitHub

Copy and paste this command:
```
git push -u origin main
```

**First time pushing?** Git will ask for credentials:

---

## 🔐 GitHub Authentication (IMPORTANT!)

GitHub no longer accepts passwords. You need a **Personal Access Token**.

### Creating Your Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**

3. Fill in:
   - **Note:** "Flappy Bird Deploy" (or any name)
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or No expiration)
   - **Select scopes:** Check the **"repo"** checkbox (this gives full repo access)

4. Scroll down and click **"Generate token"**

5. **COPY THE TOKEN NOW!** (It looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - You won't be able to see it again
   - Save it in a text file temporarily

### Using Your Token:

When Command Prompt asks:
- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** Paste your token (NOT your GitHub password!)

**Note:** When you paste the token, you won't see anything appear - that's normal! Just paste and press Enter.

## ✅ Success!

If it worked, you'll see:
```
Enumerating objects: XX, done.
Counting objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Writing objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Total XX (delta X), reused X (delta X)
To https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flappy-bird-game.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

**Go to your GitHub repository page and refresh** - you should see all your files! 🎉

## 🆘 Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "git is not recognized"
**Solution:** 
- Git is not installed or not in PATH
- Install Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Close and reopen Command Prompt after installing

### Problem: "fatal: not a git repository"
**Solution:**
- You didn't run `git init` first
- Or you're in the wrong folder
- Run `git init` in your game folder

### Problem: "error: remote origin already exists"
**Solution:**
- You already added the remote
- Remove it first: `git remote remove origin`
- Then add it again: `git remote add origin YOUR-URL`

### Problem: "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
**Solution:**
- Your GitHub repo has files (like README) that conflict
- Use: `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`
- Then: `git push -u origin main`

### Problem: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:**
- You used your GitHub password instead of a token
- Create a Personal Access Token (see above)
- Use the token as your password

### Problem: "Permission denied"
**Solution:**
- Your token doesn't have the right permissions
- Create a new token with "repo" scope checked

### Problem: Nothing happens when I paste my token
**Solution:**
- This is normal! Windows hides passwords
- Just paste and press Enter
- It's working even though you can't see it
